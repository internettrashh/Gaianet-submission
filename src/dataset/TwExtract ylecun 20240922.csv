Were  definite proof, but pretty strong evidence.

The whole point of the scientific method is to mimimize the effect of human cognitive biases, preconceived ideas, and prejudice.
Scientists make a hypothesis, then collect data to constitute evidence for whether the hypothesis is true or false.
One reason for the peer review process in science is to identify methodological flaws in a piece of work. A major characteristic of the process of science is to systematically question claims and see if results can be reproduced or not by different groups than the original authors.

The history of science is replete with experiments whose results showed the opposite of what the scientists set out to establish.

An example?
The 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to show the existence of the luminiferous aether by measuring differences in the speed of light in various directions due to the motion of the earth. Instead, it showed that the speed of light was constant and independent of the motion of the observer. This was explained theoretically by Einstein's theory of special relativity in 1905 (he used the constancy of the speed of light as a premise).",https://x.com/ylecun/status/1837119707251401026,tweet,Yann LeCun,@ylecun,438,67,64,684,502220,151,2024-09-20 18:50:44,,

2. American values, French values, and the values on which modern liberal democracies are built are very similar. There are differences in details and practice.
3. People who have lived in multiple countries (I've lived in 3 countries) see the differences in how they operate. The advantages of each country are obvious, but the flaws are also obvious. You see one thing being done right in one country, and you wonder why the other country doesn't do it right, too. I can list many things that France and Canada do right and the US doesn't, and vice versa. There are things I love and things I find infuriating on both sides. 
4. Some of the things that the US does right were sufficiently important to me in the early 1990s to prompt me to stay in the US (this was the Clinton years). That doesn't stop me from seeing the flaws and wanting to point out that other countries have solved the same problems.
5. One problem of the US is its huge superiority complex. it is unwilling to take lessons from other countries and learn how they've solved the very same problems the US is facing.

Their hate speech sews division, causes harm, and incites some of the more brainwashed followers to commit crimes motivated by hate.

The 1st Amendment protects most types of speech but does *not* protect ""incitement."" 
People who are directly hurt by an incitement to violence can sue the perpetrator. The threat of lawsuits is the only thing that stops hate speech perpetrators from going too far (that's why Trump was advised to take down his hateful tweet against Taylor Swift).

In the US, the boundary of what constitutes incitement or not has been decided by the courts. 
But the point is this: Some types of hate speech are illegal in the US *despite* the 1st Amendment.

Most of Europe has enshrined definitions of hate speech into law, rather than leaving it up to the courts.

But let's not pretend that the US has unfettered free speech while Europe has ""tyrannical"" restrictions on it.

 Some of them, e.g. in academia, study hard. 
Others had success in business, politics, science, or the arts.

Note: this does not apply to AI, Machine Learning, and most of computer science, where publication venues are open access and free for readers and authors. Almost all papers are posted on ArXiv first, which gives early open access to everyone. This greatly accelerates the dissemination of new ideas and explains in part why AI has been progressing so fast in the last 15 years (until some industry players decided to clam up, like OpenAI and to some extent Google & DeepMind). (ArXiv is largely supported by the Simons Foundation).

Conferences and journals (like JMLR and TMLR) don't need much money to operate since they use unpaid volunteers as editors, formatting is done by authors, and web hosting is cheap. Most venues use https://t.co/6fdNM7krae for the reviewing process (OpenReview is funded by donations from conferences, workshops, companies, and foundations).. Operating funds come from registration fees to conferences and donations. Conferences are run by non-profits (e.g. in ML, the ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML foundations. In CV, the Computer Vision Foundation). 

There are a few closed-access and/or for-profit outlets that some authors insist on using (still), e.g. Nature Machine Intelligence (essentially a DeepMind vassal), some IEEE conferences and journals (IEEE is non-profit but insists on charging for access to publications), and most ACM conferences and journals (ACM is non-profit but charges authors $1000 to $1800 to make their papers open access).",https://x.com/ylecun/status/1835323490498486575,tweet,Yann LeCun,@ylecun,44,13,190,1309,236175,379,2024-09-15 19:53:13,,
