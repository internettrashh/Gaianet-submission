A thread, @rettwallace @spffspcmn I'm talking about the AI industry., @ClamChowderAI @AI_EmeraldApple Sorry, but claiming in 
   of Tesla robotaxis by next year" 
was a blatant lie, not merely naïve optimism., @JosephJacks_ One has to fight the enemy of truth on his own territory., @BLSmith2112 Sorry, but claiming in 2019 "millions of Tesla robotaxis by next year" was a blatant lie, not a mere naïve optimism., @jiromihailov No, I'm a realist.
And I positively hate AI hype because I've seen the AI industry die because of hype before., @ajayjuneja Yes, I own a recent model S with FSD.
The issue is not with the product but with the lies about the product.
It was hyped as "millions of Tesla robotaxis (Level-5) by 2020" 
It's 2024, and we're still at Level-2., @olivia_p_walker I'm not saying Tesla FSD 12.X is bad.
I use it all the time.

But it's nowhere near "full" self driving.
It's certified at Level-2, nowhere near Level-4, let alone Level-5.

My problem is the hype and the lies., @tsla_niko Sorry, but this is not merely being optimistic.
It's not merely inspiring people to accelerate progress, either.
It's either incredibly naïve and ignorant optimism or deliberate lying.
I vote for deliberate lying., @realsanketp @elonmusk I don't hate Elon. I hate his lies.
I like his cars, rockets, and satellite network., I have two Tesla S. A P90D from 2015, and a recent one with so-called FSD.
FSD 12.X is useful. I use it all the time.
But it's Level-2, and nowhere near Level-4 or Level-5.
The point is not the quality of FSD 12.X, but the fact that Elon has systematically hyped its capabilities and lied about the timetable.
I knew it wasn't going to be anywhere close to Level-4 for a while because I know full well how hard it is to get beyond Level 2 or 3.
But lots of people bought the lies., @spffspcmn I'm one of those folks. I mean, FSD 12.X is nice and useful.
But it's still not *FULL* Self Driving.
I'm well positioned to know how hard it is to get beyond Level 2.
But Elon damaged the industry by his constant hype and lies., @anti_grift @alex_valaitis I'll delete it just for you: blocked., Elon: "I've kept lying to you again and again about Tesla's 'Full Self Driving' capabilities for the last 8 years, but you should believe everything I say about politics and everything else."
https://t.co/35Ow2alApE, A book does not have the scientific credibility of a multi-author, peer-reviewed article published in a reputable journal.
Such an article doesn't necessarily constitute the scientific consensus.
The real question is not:
  "did some biologist write a book asking questions?" 
but the question is:
  "what is the current consensus within the scientific community, and how much certainty there for that consensus?", @hirletz The questions are

Were  definite proof, but pretty strong evidence.

The whole point of the scientific method is to mimimize the effect of human cognitive biases, preconceived ideas, and prejudice.
Scientists make a hypothesis, then collect data to constitute evidence for whether the hypothesis is true or false.
One reason for the peer review process in science is to identify methodological flaws in a piece of work. A major characteristic of the process of science is to systematically question claims and see if results can be reproduced or not by different groups than the original authors.

The history of science is replete with experiments whose results showed the opposite of what the scientists set out to establish.

An example?
The 1887 Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to show the existence of the luminiferous aether by measuring differences in the speed of light in various directions due to the motion of the earth. Instead, it showed that the speed of light was constant and independent of the motion of the observer. This was explained theoretically by Einstein's theory of special relativity in 1905 (he used the constancy of the speed of light as a premise)., Trump's baseless accusations against the Haitians of Springfield give us a preview of the kind of America he and his cronies want to create -- a nation where your ethnicity's status as real Americans is always in danger of being revoked.

The relevance of this result and its potential for misinterpretation is exactly the same as with the statement "2-layer networks and kernel machines can approximate any function as close as we want, hence we don't need deep learning." 
[you would not believe how many times I heard this argument between 1995 and 2010].
The answer is "yes, in principle. But for almost any function of interest, the number of units in the first layer will have to be impractically large.", @GionoH @Orwelian84 No, he specifically did not., Looking forward, @kbeguir, The difference: 

The upsetting things said by Trump and Vance are not true. 

The upsetting things said about Trump and Vance are true.

Trump really did mount a violent coup against the Constitution. He and his relatives really did take bribes in office, including from foreign, @elonmusk If they actually wanted to do this, it would have been in their interest to do it *before* the coming election.
But there has been no indication of any desire to do so, before or after the election.
You're just trying to play the victim with more bEloney., *ALL* liberal democracies are grounded in freedom of speech, individual liberty, and democratic choice.
As I said, differences are in the details. 
Many EU countries have stronger rules against a concentration of media ownership than the US.
The US thinks gun ownership is essential to liberty. All other countries think that you can't have liberty if everyone walks around with guns.
The US thinks it's fine for a voter from Wyoming to have 3.6x times the influence than a voter from California in presidential elections (and 64x in senatorial elections!!!). Most EU countries abide by the basic democratic principle of "one person one vote."
All OECD countries think that paid vacations, parental leaves, access to higher education, and health insurance are basic rights. The US doesn't.
Most EU countries think you have a right not to be discriminated against vilified because of your ethnicity and other personal characteristics. The US thinks you have a right not to be discriminated against, but being vilified is just fine.


2. What matters is whether the architecture you're using can take advantage of the structure of the input efficiently. In principle, transformers can learn any structure. In practice, they can be extremely inefficient at it and not scale well., Trump killed the bipartisan immigration bill.

Prof. Lucina Qazi Uddin, a neuroscientist at UCLA, has sued these six academic publishers Elsevier, Wolters Kluwer, Wiley, Taylor &amp; Francis, Sage, and Springer Nature.


The 1st Amendment protects most types of speech but does *not* protect "incitement." 
People who are directly hurt by an incitement to violence can sue the perpetrator. The threat of lawsuits is the only thing that stops hate speech perpetrators from going too far (that's why Trump was advised to take down his hateful tweet against Taylor Swift).

In the US, the boundary of what constitutes incitement or not has been decided by the courts. 
But the point is this: Some types of hate speech are illegal in the US *despite* the 1st Amendment.

Most of Europe has enshrined definitions of hate speech into law, rather than leaving it up to the courts.

But let's not pretend that the US has unfettered free speech while Europe has "tyrannical" restrictions on it. 
That's just BS.

https://t.co/AzDG0GZxJ3, @karpathy It only works with discretized outputs (discrete symbols) and only makes sense with symbol sequences with a natural order (not images).
Text, DNA, proteins, musical scores, etc. are discrete or easily discretized., Exactly., Because the return on investment for fundamental research is way too long term for almost everyone, particularly for for-profit entities.
The few exceptions are the government, a few private foundations, and a tiny number of large and profitable companies (like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and IBM).
The bulk of funding for fundamental research *must* come from the government. There is no alternative. Overall, foundations and industry play a relatively minor role., Okay, this advantage doesn't have to do with auto-regressive prediction nor with causal connections. It has to do with the fact that the architecture prevents any output from being directly connected to its corresponding input.
Causal connection is a simple way to do that.
But one could imagine other architectures in which there is no leakage between an input and its corresponding output.
One can also build an architecture that predicts a whole bunch of tokens at once, instead of just one. It would make it non auto-regressive at the level of the bunch (there is existing work on this)., @chrisdotai @JoseAlvarezC97 That's being discussed., @0xABABAB @leopd @karpathy JEPA, @PhorenK51284 @leopd @karpathy No., @ngrilly @leopd @karpathy Yes. That's one thing that's wrong with it., @Samhanknr @leopd @karpathy No. Its input is a sequence of input tokens, and its output is the next token., @serotonin_check @leopd @karpathy Because the input space is generally discrete (or discretized).
A lot is lost in translation., @basedneoleo @leopd @karpathy Exactly. 
But no, you don't need to replace backprop., @leopd @AmanBitz @karpathy Either I don't understand your argument, or it's false.
You get gradients for every token masked or changed in the input.

You'll have to make the prediction without using the other masked tokens.
Is that what you see as a huge disadvantage?, @pmddomingos Frogs, snails, rabbits, even horses.
When I was growing up, we had horse hamburgers every Saturday.
But eating horse meat is a no-no in the US, for some reason.
So, old horses are sent to Mexico., I don't publish through commercial publishers.

But yes, a piece of research will have zero impact unless you talk about it.

That's actually the very reason we have a patent system: the government gives you a temporary exclusivity on your invention, but you have to disclose how it works., @Glaucous_Noise Cutting government funding for research would create an unmitigated disaster.

Public research funding in the US is far from perfect, but it's one of the few things the US government does better than most others.

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about., @MickeySteamboat I know people who are leaving DeepMind for that reason., @know2edgeseeker @mrbirbphd @Rwill235 All religions, and hence all religious laws, are man made., @MickeySteamboat Sergey Brin *actively* stops Google researchers from publishing stuff he thinks might be useful., @shawnchauhan1 Indeed.

It's as if you were saying that the US was still a British colony., All Western-style democracies have freedom of speech and "allow ideas to flourish by allowing people to speak freely."
Comedians don't get arrested for merely "cracking subtle jokes."
Some people do get sued by people who are hurt (actually hurt. Not just hurt in their feelings) because of hate speech directed at them., @mrbirbphd @Rwill235 I've been pretty vocal against the influence of religion in politics, regardless of the religion., Stopping speech that actually hurts people is not tyranny. 
To the people who would otherwise be hurt, it actually feels like freedom.

The US *does* have restrictions on such speech (see the Wikipedia article).
The question is not whether *some* dangerous speech should be illegal (that's already the case), but precisely *what* speech is considered dangerous and should be illegal.

The EU sees incitement to racial hatred as dangerous, the US doesn't. 

But people *do* get hurt by the type of speech Trump, Vance, and the far-right Twittersphere have been spewing against immigrants (particularly Haitian refugees in Ohio). Schools are closed. There are bomb threats and death threats.

Last time I was in Portugal, there were cats in the streets and delicious sardines on our plates., There is no such thing as a "ruling elite."
I think I would have seen it by now, and I haven't. 
There are people who end up acquiring some intellectual influence or some decision power. 
Most of them get there because they have talent and work hard.
 Some of them, e.g. in academia, study hard. 
Others had success in business, politics, science, or the arts. 
In democratic regimes, people need to get elected to acquire political power.

The people you should really be suspicious of are the ones who got where they were, not by their talent and hard work, but by the money inherited from their family.
They are the closest thing we have to an illegitimate "ruling elite."
A perfect example is Trump., Swiftboated., @freddo411 Same as in the US: the courts decide.
There are many, many types of unprotected speech in the US that you can get sued for. EU countries only have one more: incitement to racial hatred.
https://t.co/rIPy9G0MEQ, @NarniaG20 It doesn't., No. 
Neither was Algeria nor the West Africa colonies.
This ended in the 1960s.
My dad was sent to fight the Algerian war during his mandatory military service in the late 1950s.
He didn't like it one bit.



Today, making such an accusation publicly against an ethnic group violates laws against "incitement to racial hatred" in most of Europe.
You may get sued, get a fine, and get blocked from running for office.

Elon and other American 1st Amendment maximalists will scream "tyranny!"
But anti-hate speech laws are the way European countries have learned to protect themselves against fascist takeovers.
And they sure know what they're talking about., Very funny.
In the US, 13.8% of the population is foreign born.
In Norway? 
15% 😂

In France 10.3%, Germany 18%, Switzerland 40%, UAE 88%., Yesss!

Note: this does not apply to AI, Machine Learning, and most of computer science, where publication venues are open access and free for readers and authors. Almost all papers are posted on ArXiv first, which gives early open access to everyone. This greatly accelerates the dissemination of new ideas and explains in part why AI has been progressing so fast in the last 15 years (until some industry players decided to clam up, like OpenAI and to some extent Google & DeepMind). (ArXiv is largely supported by the Simons Foundation).

Conferences and journals (like JMLR and TMLR) don't need much money to operate since they use unpaid volunteers as editors, formatting is done by authors, and web hosting is cheap. Most venues use https://t.co/6fdNM7krae for the reviewing process (OpenReview is funded by donations from conferences, workshops, companies, and foundations).. Operating funds come from registration fees to conferences and donations. Conferences are run by non-profits (e.g. in ML, the ICLR, NeurIPS, and ICML foundations. In CV, the Computer Vision Foundation). 

There are a few closed-access and/or for-profit outlets that some authors insist on using (still), e.g. Nature Machine Intelligence (essentially a DeepMind vassal), some IEEE conferences and journals (IEEE is non-profit but insists on charging for access to publications), and most ACM conferences and journals (ACM is non-profit but charges authors $1000 to $1800 to make their papers open access)., Even George Will endorsed Kamala over Trump.
Given his staunch conservative stance, this tells you a lot about how dangerous he thinks Trump is. 
He is joining Dick Cheney and most of the high-ranking officials of the former Trump administration., A glimpse into the future if we allow this man to be President again… 

https://t.co/LIJI1RpZ2V https://t.co/xCreny18x7, This is completely made up, of course, just like all the rest. But what's more important is that immigration makes Social Security and Medicare more sustainable, and cutting off immigration is a way of forcing cuts to those programs., The problem has to do with auto-regressive prediction, not with the architecture used to do so (transformers or whatever).
Auto-regresssive prediction for things that are not temporal sequences (with some temporal causality) is a pure abomination.
Even for temporal sequences, auto-regression *in input space* is inferior to auto-regression in representation space: a dynamics is not necessarily represented efficiently by a sequence of past inputs., @elonmusk Yes, save AI-generated pets!, @elonmusk One may debate whether helping Iraq stamp down an insurgency in their own territory qualifies as "an active war zone." (though it does qualify as combat).

In the interest of factuality, now post every one of Trump's lies., Far-right movements have been using Springfield, Ohio as a propaganda tool since early 2023.
